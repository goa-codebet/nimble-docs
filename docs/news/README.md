  **Nimble-utils development has started**
  
  As a part of an initiative at [Codebet](https://www.codebet.se) that we like to call 'open source friday'
  the npm package Nimble-utils has started being developed. With the aim of solving styling in React native, the
  package will provide the user with a utility belt that will help improve and speed up the styling process.
