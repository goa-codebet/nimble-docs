  **We have set on a name**

  ### Nimble-utils

  We have finally decided on a name for our package. Since 'nimble' alone was of course
  ocupado so we had to go with nimble with a twist which turned out to be 'nimble-utils'.
  We thoguht that would be a quick and easy name to remember and also be a bit descriptive.

  **Initial design has begun**

  Every great npm package have a equally great documentation site. In order for the user to know how to utilize
  the package, we are of course creating a documentation site to go along with it.

  **Nimble-utils development has started**
  
  As a part of an initiative at [Codebet](https://www.codebet.se) that we like to call 'open source friday'
  the npm package Nimble-utils has started being developed. With the aim of solving styling in React native, the
  package will provide the user with a utility belt that will help improve and speed up the styling process.
